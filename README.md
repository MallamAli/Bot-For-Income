## Trading Strategies

### Arbitrage

Arbitrage involves buying and selling the same asset on different exchanges to profit from price discrepancies. The bot automatically identifies these opportunities and executes trades.

### Trend Following

This strategy involves analyzing market trends and making trades based on the direction of those trends. The bot can be configured to follow various indicators to determine when to buy or sell.
